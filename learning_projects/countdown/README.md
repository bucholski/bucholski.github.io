## Overview
I'm quite happy with this one. I didn't go for the card flipping on number changes, even though I believe I could make it work. For now I believe that getting into some jQuery or some JS framework is the priority for me. Maybe I'll add this functionality some other time. Probably not.  

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- ~~**Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle~~

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I certainly learned the basics of how to work with dates and time flow in JavaScript. I feel like the function that changes time values could be more modular, but for the size of the project I believe it is acceptable. 
I do my best to apply BEM to all somewhat complex elements. 
I further learned about Sass and SCSS while working on this project. 


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
