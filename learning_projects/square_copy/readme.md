## Copy of squareup.com

Goals: Copy vital parts of the single part of a website using only vanilla JS, CSS and HTML.

This is the first project I have completed. My goal was to copy all vital and some content parts of a single but somewhat complex page of a website that seemed well designed to me.

After some research I decided to go with squareup.com as it looks good and I believed that I'll be able to copy most of it.

I went with only the most important sections of the site and skipped several content sections of the original. I think I've covered most of the interactive elements, however. 

I have learned a lot from this project - I had to find my way around problems I have not encountered yet. I have deepened my understanding of many CSS and JS nuances. I have also found out that I need to start employing some sort of coding methodology, since at the end of working on this I was getting more and more lost in my code, both JS and CSS.

Overall I'm happy with the results, but I believe that if the project was any bigger, my poor code organisation would make it very difficult to finish.
